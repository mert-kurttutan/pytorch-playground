# Pytorch Playground Repo

This repository is created to function as a general pytorch module to be used for various experimental settings, e.g. experimenting with custom architectures, Kaggle, Google colab.

## Explanation
Source code folder `src` contains several components:
- [data](src/data): dataset pipelines, dataset objects
- [model](src/model): custom implementation of NN architectures
- [trainer.py](src/model/trainer.py): Trainer object, heavily inspired by [minGPT repo](https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT)
